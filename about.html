        Having been an avid player of story-driven games for over five years, 
        I’ve experienced a wide range of titles, including Red Dead Redemption 2,
         Kingdom Come: Deliverance (both 1 and 2), God of War 4, Ragnarök, and many more. 
         Through these experiences, I've developed a unique understanding of
          these games—some more than others—and I’m here to pass that knowledge along to you.
